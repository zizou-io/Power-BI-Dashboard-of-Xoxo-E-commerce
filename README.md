Focusing on XOXO E-commerce sales information, I have completed the E-commerce Sales Data Analysis and Visualization project using Power BI,  Here is a summary of the processes I undertook:

1. **Data Transformation:**
   - Transformed and cleaned the raw sales data into a structured format suitable for analysis in Power BI using Power Query.

2. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics and answer specific questions about the sales data.
   - Included visualizations for profits in each month, payment methods distribution, leading category contributions to sales, and more.

3. **Interactive Features:**
   - Added slicers for presenting information for every quarter, allowing for easy access and further inspection of the data.

4. **Insights and Analysis:**
   - Analyzed the data to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to sales, profits, payment methods, and product categories.
   - Used visualizations to effectively communicate these insights to stakeholders.

5. **Presentation:**
   - Prepared a presentation showcasing the Power BI dashboard, explaining the analysis process, findings, and insights.
   - Included visuals, explanations, and recommendations for XOXO Ecommerce based on the analysis.

Thank for your time.
